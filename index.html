      <h3>What we are doing:</h3>
      <p>Component Manufacturing in simple terms, is nothing but the process through which material undergoes transformation right from its
         basic form (cast / forged /Rolled / fabricated etc ) to finished form ( Ready
         for assembly into the machine / equipment )</p>
      <p> With ever increasing demands on productsâ€™ performance, efficiency, safety,
          robustness, reliability, longevity, compactness and eco-friendliness, the
          demand ( quality and reliability ) at component level has become even more
          stringent. This has reflected not only in design and material selection 
          but also in the type of process adopted during manufacturing.</p>
      <p> There are many ways to manufacture a component but the one that
          guarantees the desired quality, productivity with cost effectiveness is what
          every manufacturer is looking  for. From our vast experience we offer.</p>
